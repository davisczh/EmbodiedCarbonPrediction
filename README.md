"# EmbodiedCarbonPrediction"

- EDA.ipynb explores inital exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. It also explores the naive approach, where a simple pipeline is used to predict the embodied carbon value.
- EC-prediction-experiment.ipynb merges 2 datasets together. It explores some feature engineering, different approaches of encoding and scaling of the features and a more sophisticated pipeline, where individual material have its own predictor.
